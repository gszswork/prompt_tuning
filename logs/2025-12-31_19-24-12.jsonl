Then, match this action with the provided options.\n\n3) Execute with rigor:\n- When a traffic light turns yellow, drivers are generally expected to slow down to prepare to stop if it is safe to do so. This aligns with option E: slow down.\n\n4) Validate:\n- The action of slowing down is consistent with traffic rules and common driving practices when approaching a yellow light. Other options like \"take time,\" \"dawdle,\" or \"go slowly\" do not specifically capture the immediate action required by a yellow light. \"Ocean\" is irrelevant in this context.\n\n5) Communicate clearly:\n- The correct answer is E: slow down.
