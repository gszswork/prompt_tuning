(2) Note the key assumptions/inputs and the minimal information needed; ask concise clarifying questions only if required. (3) Provide the solution/plan in clear, ordered steps. (4) Check for errors, constraints, and edge cases; include brief mitigations. (5) Present a clean final answer (or actionable next steps) with concise formatting.",
